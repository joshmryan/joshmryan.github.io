I am a coauthor, along with David Doherty, and Scott Minkoff, on the Greenberg and Page introductory American politics textbook, \`\`The Struggle for Democracy." The book takes an innovate approach to helping students understand American politics by centering the question of, "How democratic is American politics?" In the book we compare the democratic ideal to existing institutions and collective political behavior to engage students and help them think critically about how our government works.

Separate chapters on civil liberties and civil rights

-   Two policy chapters (domestic and foreign)

-   Separate chapters on interest groups and social movements

-   Pyramid scheme in each chapter that organizes and links concepts for students

Most instructors use the Revel platform. It is a fully digital book platform that includes:

-   Up-to-date interactive graphs, maps, and figures

-   Current events bulletins in each chapter to connect modern political issues with chapter topics

-   Multiple choice quiz questions after each chapter section (that connect with your course management software)

-   The ability to track student reading times

-   Lecture launchers for each chapter that help instructors to introduce class sections that connect current events directly with the text.


Costs vary based on the subscription model chosen by the instructor or university, the entire textbook through the Revel platform is typically available to the student for under \$70.

Please feel free to contact me at josh.ryan\@usu.edu if you have any questions about adopting the book for your introductory American politics classes.
