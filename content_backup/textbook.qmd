::: column-body
I am a coauthor, along with [David Doherty](https://ddoherty.sites.luc.edu/index.html), and [Scott Minkoff](http://scottminkoff.com/), on the Greenberg and Page introductory American politics textbook, "The Struggle for Democracy." The book takes an innovate approach to helping students understand American politics by centering the question of, "How democratic is American politics?" In the book we compare the democratic ideal to existing institutions and collective political behavior to engage students and help them think critically about how our government works. The book also emphasizes American politics in historical and comparative perspectives.

-   Separate chapters on civil liberties and civil rights

-   Two policy chapters (domestic and foreign)

-   Separate chapters on interest groups and social movements

-   A pyramid graphic which provides a consistent theoretical framework in each chapter that organizes and links concepts for students

Most instructors use the Revel platform. It is a fully digital book platform that includes:

-   Up-to-date interactive graphs, maps, and figures

-   Current events bulletins in each chapter to connect modern political issues with chapter topics

-   Multiple choice quiz questions after each chapter section (that connect with your course management software)

-   The ability to track student reading times

-   Lecture launchers for each chapter that help instructors introduce class sections that connect current events directly with the text

The price varies based on the subscription model chosen by the instructor or university, though the entire textbook through the Revel platform is typically available to students for under \$70.
