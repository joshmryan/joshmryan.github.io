    "section": "",
    "text": "Yellowstone Cutthroat–Raft River Mountains\nThis is widely accepted to be the most difficult fish in the slam to catch. For most people, the Raft River Range is the farthest drive, the creeks are tiny, and there isn’t a ton of information on where to catch the fish. Some of the online promotional videos I’ve seen show people fishing water in private land or only make vague references to access points. I couldn’t figure any of this out so I stuck to the most obvious water: Onemile Creek. There is a forest road that goes up it, and the research I did seemed to suggest this was the best bet.\nWhen I drove up the forest road, there was a jeep parked in a turnout: another guy and his wife also looking to catch the Yellowstone for their slam. From that turnout, they mentioned there is a relatively well-defined hole only a short walk up the creek where they’d brought a fish up. Onemile creek is very small and honestly, doesn’t even look like it can hold fish but unlike a lot of creeks this size in Utah, it wasn’t that brushy. I started downstream of the hole they mentioned, fished up to it, and had absolutely no success. I hooked a shockingly large fish in that hole, got it to the surface and lost it. I made a few more casts, but it was clear the fish wasn’t coming back. I continued fishing up Onemile Creek for a while, and found no signs of life.\n Onemile creek is small.\nAt that point I wasn’t sure what to do. Downstream of the turnout where I first parked, there was another bad looking forest road that went across the creek and into another drainage. The creek just seems to be called Sawmill Canyon and I wasn’t sure it was even fishable, but I had read that it held Yellowstone cutts. I also wasn’t sure if I could get my car up the road so I rode my mountain bike on the road over a short hill and then up the canyon. I picked an arbitrary point to take the quick hike down to the creek from the road. Sawmill Canyon was even smaller than Onemile and was very brushy.\nThis all seemed futile as I started fishing but pretty quickly thought I had some fish hitting my sinking fly. I wasn’t entirely sure they were bites, but it did give me motivation to keep fishing. Within less than an hour, I caught a small Yellowstone cutt out of Sawmill. I caught a few more, all smaller than 6 inches. The fishing isn’t easy, but there seem to be more fish than in Onemile, and I think it gets less pressure. It wasn’t all that hard to get to either, the walk/bike in was maybe a mile or mile and a half.\n Sawmill canyon is small and brushy.\nThere is a nice forest service campground nearby on Clear Creek, along with lots of dispersed camping. We were going to try and summit Bull Moutain the next day (highest point in the Raft River Range), but it started thunderstorming early in the morning so we left and drove back to Cache Valley. Clear Creek is quite fun to fish as there are a ton of fish that seemed to look like cutts, but I think they are Inland Redband trout, as they are missing the orange slash under the jaw and have a pink lateral stripe. The DWR’s website does not mention Clear Creek as a possible water in which to find Yellowstones.\n Trout from Clear Creek. I think these are Inland Redband trout.\n\n\nColorado River Cutthroat–Boulder Mountain\nLiving in Cache Valley is an advantage for reaching the Bear River and Yellowstone cutts (the Raft River is less than a two hour drive from Cache Valley), but it is a decided disadvantage for the next fish I attempted to catch, the Colorado River cutt. This one is probably slightly easier to catch than the Yellowstone, but the geography of its native waters make it a long trip from Cache Valley. I had a trip planned to the Capitol Reef area for some hiking, so I did research on streams near the park entrance that might hold Colorado River cutts. When we visit Capitol Reef we like to stay at a nice forest service campground about a half hour from the park entrance. The DWR website lists Pine Creek as close to that area so I started there with really no other plan if that didn’t work. Pine Creek flows off the northwest side of Boulder Mountain, but access is at a low enough elevation that isn’t too far a drive from Bicknell.\n Pine Creek, near Bicknell, UT\nI could find almost no information on the fishing aside from that single mention on the website so I had no idea what the road condition was, how big the creek was, or where to fish. The road turned out to be a good forest service road that I drove up until I found a spot to pull over and walk to the creek. Where I parked, the road isn’t alongside the creek so you can’t see the water until you get close. Surprise, surprise, Pine Creek is tiny with what I would characterize as “moderate” brush (a running theme for Utah fly fishing). But, on walking up to the creek, I could see fish!\nDespite the look of the creek, it was relatively easy fishing; I found a brush-free spot, made a cast with a dry fly, and usually hooked a small fish. I caught a few quickly and had a nice time working my way upstream. I had plans to leave and fish the Fremont which is supposed to hold larger brown trout but as I was packing up after fishing Pine Creek, I stepped on my rod and broke it. I didn’t realize this until I drove to the Fremont, made a cast, and the top of my rod flew off. Good times.\n\n\nBonneville Cutthroat–Salt Lake City Area\nI left the Bonneville for last as I assumed it would be the easiest. I am in Salt Lake City often enough that I thought I’d just catch it quickly when in the area. Unfortunately, by the end of the Summer, I’d just hadn’t gotten around to it. After an airport run, I thought I’d just go to one the creeks that flows out of the Wasatch into the valley. The closest water to the airport I could find was Mill Creek, which is right above the City and holds Bonnies according to the DWR website. I’d never been up there so I had no idea what the fishing was like.\nIt turns out Mill Creek Canyon is a very popular place to recreate on a Sunday afternoon. And you have to pay to recreate in the canyon, (on the way out for some reason). I fought traffic, found a place to park on the road, and walked down the creek. This was late September and I was surprised to find a little snow on the ground because the sun doesn’t reach the creek in the fall or winter months. The shadows, combined with the warmish air temperature which caused the snow to melt and re-freeze, produced maximum slickness when wading.\n Mill Creek.\nAlso, unsurprisingly, Mill Creek is tiny and moderately brushy, looking okay in terms of fishability. The low light in the canyon made it difficult to see my dry fly and for about the first hour, nothing happened. This was all very annoying because the Bonnie was supposed to be the easy one. I began thinking the DWR made a mistake and regretting my decision to fish Mill Creek. I finally hooked a fish, after a tough, cold wade. On the way out, I had to sit in traffic waiting to pay the fee. I completed the cutt slam in one year, but I feel comfortable saying that will be my last visit to Mill Canyon.\nI probably should have gone to a larger, nicer river to catch the Bonnie and most anglers will drive from Salt Lake City to the north slope of the Uintas to catch the fish there, or fish the Ogden or Weber. All are good options; Mill Creek has the advantage of being twenty minutes from SLC, but the experience is not what we think of in terms of western trout fishing.\n\n\nSummary\nRelative to the other state slams I’ve done or attempted, Utah was the easiest, and is a good starter slam. The driving distances are likely shorter than in Wyoming, and the fishing is pretty easy with the exception of the Yellowstone Cutt. The Bear River and Bonneville should, more or less, be gimmes, with the Colorado River somewhat tougher (though I got lucky Pine Creek was a good spot). Catching the Yellowstone out of Sawmill Canyon felt like a miracle, especially after having zero success in Onemile. There are other creeks listed on the DWR website that hold Yellowstones, but my impression is that they required significantly more effort to reach. If I were going back, I would give myself some backup options if neither Onemile nor Sawmill worked, but I’m not sure what those backup options would be given what I perceive to be access issues o the other creeks.\nBack to Main Page"

Also, most of these spots (with a few exceptions) are not exactly blue ribbon, 20-inch fish, trout streams. The vast majority of waters I have fished, especially in Utah and Nevada, are small and brushy with small fish. I write about the Logan and other Cache Valley rivers in greater detail because these are my local fishing spots, but the Logan is already well-known as high quality fly fishing river. A google search for “Logan River fishing” shows that the first two results are from visitUtah.com and Utah.com. Mostly, I hope this website provides valuable information for others interested in fly fishing or pursuing trout challenges."

    "title": "Wyoming Cutt Slam",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Despite the long driving distances, I thought it would be easier than the Utah slam–Wyoming has more options for each fish, bigger water (less brush), and at the time, had more resources online to help plan a fishing trip. Wyoming has a program called “Instream Flow” that provides helpful information on lots of different rivers and creeks, and a related program called “XStream Angler” in which you receive a hat if you a take a picture of yourself near three qualifying rivers or creeks. This is an easy thing to complete when you do your slam as most waters fished in the slam are also considered “instream flow” rivers. When I did the slam a few years ago, I think they required pictures near seven rivers, but perhaps that was too demanding.\nBonneville Cutthroat–Hobble Creek\nBonneville Cutts are found in rivers that flow into the Great Basin. Utah further separates species into Bear River and Bonneville, while Wyoming makes no such distinct. I don’t know what the scientific case is for calling the Bear River and Bonneville separate species, and I suspect Utah does it because they can’t have a fish slam with only three species. Regardless, Hobble Creek flows into the Bear River via the Smiths Fork from the Wyoming Range outside of Cokeville, Wyoming. It’s only about an hour and a half from my home in Cache Valley, Utah so this was the first place I started. I’ve now done quite a bit of hiking, camping, and fishing in the Wyoming Range and adjacent Salt River Range, both of which are incredibly underrated.\nMy driving plan was somewhat convoluted, and in retrospect, I did not do this correctly. Once I’d caught the Bonneville, I would go up a road that follows the Smiths Fork north, take that up and over to the Tri-Basin divide, fish for the Colorado River Cutthroat in LaBarge Creek, then go down Greys River Road to fish for Snake River cutthroat. This didn’t work because the road up Smiths Fork to connect with the Tri-Basin divide slowly deteriorated as we drove up it. Eventually, we came to a spot where the road turned into a giant mud puddle and though it looked like I might be able to get my truck through it, I decided discretion was the better part of valor and turned around. I once got stuck in mud on a dirt road in Kansas, and that experience scarred me so deeply I have become extremely risk averse with muddy roads. Unfortunately, this meant going all the way back out to Cokeville and driving around the southern end of the Wyoming Range. It also changed the creeks I would fish, which ended up having significant consequences.\nHobble Creek is reached by a long drive on relatively good forest roads up until the last mile or so when there is a creek crossing. High clearance vehicles should have no problem but I wouldn’t take a sedan across the creek. Unfortunately, there isn’t really a spot for dispersed camping at the crossing that I could see, so it’s important to get to the campground farther down the road. There is also a parking lot for Lake Alice, which is about a two mile hike from the campground, a nice sidetrip with an interesting geological history. This area is used quite a bit by locals visiting the lake on daytrips, but there was only one other site taken in the campground. I think the creek receives a moderate amount of pressure farther downstream as I’ve seen a few people fishing it the times I’ve been up there.\n Into a big brown on Hobble Creek\nAlice Creek, which flows out of Lake Alice, comes into Hobble right at the campground, and the flow is greater after their confluence. When you first enter Hobble Creek canyon on the forest road, before the campground, Coantag Creek joins up with Hobble Creek and also significantly increases the flow into Hobble. I think most people fish from this point downstream because it’s a bigger creek so they assume it holds bigger fish, and it’s the closest road access for people who drive up for the day.\nI’ve only fished upstream from Coantag Creek, on Hobble Creek up to Alice Creek, then above Alice Creek. Besides the increased pressure, the problem with fishing downstream of Coantag Creek is that it if you stay in the campground, you’d likely have to get back in your car and drive downstream approximately a mile or two to get back to this water. That didn’t make much sense to me so I just walked down the road to get downstream of the campground then fished back up to it. I’ve fished Hobble Creek a few times now, and I can promise there are very large fish, both cutts and browns, upstream of Coantag Creek near the campground.\nWhen I was fishing for the slam, it was my first time fishing Hobble. On the Logan, my “home river,” there is a fish in every soft spot on the river, almost behind every rock. Because that was what I was used to, and I didn’t have a lot of experience fishing other rivers, I expected to have higher catch rates in Hobble Creek. In fact, when we arrived at the campground in the late afternoon, I walked upstream of the campground and found a nice hole with an undercut bank. Almost immediately, I hooked into a large fish that ended up being a brown. I wasn’t expecting brown trout in Hobble Creek as I thought it was all cutthroat, so though it was a 15 inch plus fish, it didn’t count for the slam. That first fish fooled me because I thought the fishing was going to be easy but I had a more difficult time catching a cutthroat the next morning.\nI wasted a lot of time fishing spots that in retrospect weren’t likely to hold fish. Eventually, I caught exactly one cutthroat and a few additional browns, and had my first fish of the Wyoming slam. Hobble Creek has since become one of my favorite fishing and camping spots, and I’ve subsequently caught very large (nearly 20 inch) cutthroats in the creek, though there are perhaps not as many fish as I would expect given how good the water looks.\nOn that first trip, the first large brown I caught made for a delicious dinner. I usually practice catch and release, and I would never keep a cutthroat in a native drainage, but I view browns in these drainages as an invasive species so I sometimes eat them.\n Catch and cook.\nColorado River Cutthroat–Attempt Number 1, Various Creeks\nAs I described above, an attempt to take the road which parallels the Smiths Fork over to Tri-Basin Divide didn’t work as the road was impassable. I was worried this was going to happen and it added hours of driving. Smiths Fork above Cokeville, near the turnoff to the road to Hobble Creek is a large-ish river that is supposed to have very good fishing. However, access is a bit of a problem as most of the river is private, and there is nowhere to camp nearby. This could be an option for the Bonneville if one wanted to stay in a hotel near Cokeville, though I believe the Smiths Fork also has browns in it. I chose Hobble Creek because it offered convenient camping. I later fished the Smiths Fork up much higher, closer to the Tri-Basin divide, which has much better forest road access (the road I was attempting to connect to). There is abundant and excellent dispersed camping in this area, but surprisingly, the fishing wasn’t very good for me over two nights of camping. I caught a few fish here and there but really struggled. I’ve only fished it that one time so I’m not sure if that was bad technique on my part or if the fishing really isn’t that great.\nWhat the vast majority of people do when attempting the Wyoming Slam is center their efforts on Tri-Basin divide. You can catch the Bonneville in Smiths Fork, drive a very short way to catch the Colorado River in LaBarge Creek, then go down Greys River Road to catch the Snake river. You can catch all three of these fish within maybe a ten mile radius. Because I couldn’t connect up to Tri-Basin, I drove around the southern end of the Wyoming Range to fish the creeks coming off the east side of the range, then connected over to the Greys on forest roads via McDougal Gap. Again, literally every Wyoming Cutt Slam tale online says to fish LaBarge Creek, but I didn’t want to have to drive up LaBarge Creek road then down Greys River road as that would add significant time (I thought). Because the Wyoming Fish and Game lists a number of creeks on the east side of the Wyoming Range as holding cutts, I thought I would just fish these. The night after leaving Hobble, we camped at Sacajawea Campground which is located on Middle Piney Creek.\n Middle Piney creek near Sacajawea Campground. Small, but should have given more effort. The smoke started moving in.\nSacajawea is another amazing, nearly deserted forest service campground in Wyoming that should be crowded. Unfortunately, Middle Piney Creek was tiny and my brief efforts to fish on evening arrival didn’t yield anything. Here is where feeling time pressured got to me. Instead of giving Middle Piney a real chance, the next day we decided to begin heading to Greys River Road and fishing along the way. Before I complain about the fishing, I will say this drive is spectacular. The first stop was North Piney Creek. The fishing was slow but I did manage to catch a brook trout, which was not helpful. The second stop was South Cottonwood Creek, which is on the forest road which goes over McDougal Gap. After about an hour of fishing unsuccessfully, I finally caught a small brook trout. This was very frustrating, and out of ideas, I gave up and we drove over McDougal Gap to the Greys River.\n North Piney Creek. Looks good, caught nothing but a few brooks.\n Same story on South Cottonwood.\n Driving between basins on east side of Wyoming Range.\nSnake River Cutthroat–Greys River\nThe Greys River forms in the Tri-Basin divide and Greys River Road runs its entire length, from there to Alpine, WY where the Greys meets the Snake in Palisades Resevoir. The road is well maintained and well traveled, and while this area isn’t exactly deserted, its not so crowded as to be unpleasant. The scenery is spectacular and the fishing is supposed to be very good as well. We stayed in Forest Park Campground which is just upriver from where the forest road over McDougal Gap meets Greys River Road. Forest Park was also mostly empty, though a lot of people prefer to disperse camp along the Greys River.\n Over McDougal Gap into Greys River drainage, forest road at bottom left. It had been smoky all day.\nI eventually caught my Snake River cutt in the Greys. It was not spectacular fishing in terms of catch rate or size, but the surroundings made up for much of that. It was very hot when I was there, and nothing really started happening until late in the afternoon. I’d already been fishing for a few hours so I caught maybe three or four medium size cutts and called it. We had a very long drive planned the next day, and I was frustrated after my lack of success fishing for the Colorado River cutt.\nOddly, I’ve never fished the Greys again, despite passing by it a number of times. There isn’t a good reason for that, other than I’ve never really gotten around to it. I would like to drive its entire length from Alpine to Tri-Basin divide. Years later, for my Western Native Trout Challenge, I fished the very top of LaBarge Creek and caught a Colorado River cutt, but didn’t make it down to the Greys. I’d like to determine whether my slow evenings on both the Smiths Fork and Greys River were aberrations or if the fishing is not as good as reports suggest. One other note on Greys River road: when leaving Greys River Road and entering Alpine, a stop at Melvin’s Brewery is mandatory.\nYellowstone Cutthroat–Greybull River\nWas the drive from Alpine, though Jackson, Teton National Park, Yellowstone National Park, out to Cody, and to the Greybull River a frustrating slog through bumper-to-bumper traffic? Of course and there is no reason to elaborate. Outside of Cody, and closer to Meeteetse, WY, there are quite a few possibilities for the Yellowstone cutthroat. Both the Greybull and Wood River are supposed to have fantastic fishing, and I chose the Greybull for reasons I don’t remember.\n Sunset over Jack Creek Campground.\nThe road from Meeteetse to Jack Creek Campground, on the Greybull, is long and rough, but as per usual, there was not a single other campsite taken. This is incredible to me given how close it is to the hordes nearby in Yellowstone. The scenery is incredible, the river looks like a classic, western blue-ribbon trout stream, and the grizzly bears are, apparently, plentiful. Jack Creek campground is a place I wanted to stay for a week, and fortunately, the fishing lived up to its promise.\nThis was by far, the most enjoyable experience of the whole trip. The evening we arrived, I fished the river almost behind my campsite and immediately caught a few nice cutthroat. There were fish rising everywhere, and it’s clear the river doesn’t see a lot of pressure. The next morning I fished again, and again caught quite a few fish. The Greybull is extremely slick to wade, and I kept an eye out for grizzlies, but the fishing was amazing. My catch rate was high, the average fish size was probably about 12 inches, with a few pushing 15. These experiences are so enjoyable, but in many ways the story is short and not that interesting: I showed up, got a nice campsite, caught a lot of fish in amazing scenery.\n Greybull River in the morning.\nSummary\nPerhaps part of the reason why the Greybull was so enjoyable is that once I caught my fish the evening we arrived, the pressure was off. It was the last stop before I went home, and I had caught three of the four. Again, the lesson (for me, anyway) seems to be not to rush things. I wish I could have stayed longer at each spot and really learned the river or creek. As I mentioned, I’ve fished Hobble Creek a few times now, and I’ve had some amazing experiences on that water because I’ve been able to explore it more and understand the fish in the creek better. When fishing for an evening or morning on the way to the next spot, one doesn’t get to unlock the fishing on a particular water at all.\nOn the other hand, most of us have jobs, families, regular lives to live, and we can’t spend three or four days in one spot if we’re trying to finish the slam. Perhaps two full nights at each spot is optimal, but that means eight nights, not including driving days. And, if catching a particular species isn’t successful, then one has to decide pretty quickly whether they are going to move on, or burn all their time working on one fish.\nThe Wyoming slam was the first slam and remains the most famous for a reason. The driving was a hassle, especially through Yellowstone at the height of summer. I had done it a few years before and promised myself never again, then I did it again. This time, I really won’t do it again. But, Western Wyoming is an amazing place and there is so much to do and see besides Teton and Yellowstone. My trip didn’t even touch the Bighorns or Wind River range. I would love to go back to the Meeteetse area and fish the Greybull again, but also the Wood and the smaller creeks in that area. It’s rumored that Fenn’s Treasure was hidden in the Wood River drainage, though recent reports suggest it was in Yellowstone National Park which is to the west of the Shoshone National Forest, where most of the Greybull and Wood River drainages are located.\nPerhaps because I live in Utah, the Wyoming slam felt bigger, more interesting, and more classically “western.” There weren’t any tiny, brushy creeks on this trip, and though I didn’t go to any of the really famous Wyoming waters, the fishing was mostly very good. These are big, but not too big rivers, pressure is light, campgrounds are quite, and the scenery is excellent.\nIn some ways the Wyoming Cutt Slam is easier than the Utah one because the fishing is probably a little more straightforward, with the exception of the Colorado River Cutt. I think LaBarge Creek is the obvious place to go now, though I’ve read reports online that it can sometimes be difficult fishing. I fished it in the Tri-Basin Divide once, after I’d completed my slam, and I caught some small cutts without too much difficulty.\nThe Bonneville could also be a little tricky if the Smiths Fork or Hobble Creek don’t work, and in both of those you’ll have to fight through the browns, and possibly rainbows or brooks. I know nothing about the other creeks listed on the Fish and Game’s website, but when researching this trip, they didn’t seem like good options for one reason or another.\nThe logistics in Wyoming are more difficult than Utah however, and if for some reason you struck out on a particular river and had to come back, it’s likely going to be a lot of travel time. I also got relatively lucky with the weather, with the only real challenge coming on the Greys where it was very hot. The air quality in the Wyoming Range was not great due to smoke, but fly fishing is not aerobic so it wasn’t a big deal other than obscuring some of the scenery. Summers in the West are increasingly unpredictable and very hot weather, fires, smoke, or heavy rain can derail plans. For these reasons, I think Utah is still probably the easier first cutt slam to attempt, but it’s close between the two.\nBack to Main Page"

Nevada also refers to their contest as a “fish slam” rather than a “cutt slam” because two of the fish are not cutthroat trout."
