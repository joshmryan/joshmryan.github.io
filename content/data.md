A revised and updated version of the U.S. House Committee Votes dataset is available at the link below. This data is available for non-commercial use, and currently extends from the 104th-114th Congresses. We plan on completing an update of the data soon for the 115th through 118th Congresses, and will continue regular updates. Contact <a href="mailto:josh.ryan@usu.edu">Josh Ryan</a> with any questions, suggestions, or corrections.

See the attached working paper for additional details on the dataset. A codebook is included in Appendix B.

**I am currently working on an update for the 115th through 118th Congresses. Changes to how committees report these votes have slowed the process, but as of Summer 2025, I have made substantial progress and hope to update the data by Fall 2025.**

This version: ~~November 1, 2022.~~ December 2, 2022 (updated to include vote descriptions).
