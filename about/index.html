            <p>I am Professor of Political Science at Utah State University in Logan, UT. My research focuses on American institutions, especially Congress, the president, state legislatures and executives, as well as electoral institutions. I am interested in the policy process, bicameral dynamics, legislative productivity, and agenda formation in legislatures, and how institutions structure representation and elite behavior.</p>
<p>My research has been published in <em>The Journal of Politics</em>, <em>Legislative Studies Quarterly</em>, <em>Political Science Research and Methods</em>, and <em>Political Research Quarterly</em>, among other outlets. My book, <a href="https://press-uchicago-edu.dist.lib.usu.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo28907983.html">The Congressional Endgame: Interchamber Bargaining and Resolution</a>, published by the University of Chicago Press, explores the postpassage bargaining process in Congress. I have twice (2016, 2021) been awarded the Jewell-Loewenberg Award for the best article published on American politics in Legislative Studies Quarterly.</p>
<p>At Utah State, I enjoy teaching courses on American politics and research methods. I seek to emphasize how social science can help us understand fundamental questions about the American political system. I also encourage students to participate in the research process, and have had a number of undergraduate and graduate students participate at national conferences and admitted to Ph.D. programs.</p>
<p>I am originally from Southern California and majored in political science and minored in Spanish literature at UCSD. I attended UCDC and interned on Capitol Hill for the <a href="https://www.eesi.org/">Environmental and Energy Study Institute</a>. Prior to becoming a political scientist, I worked as a contractor for HUD in Los Angeles conducting compliance reviews of project-based Section 8 housing. In my free time I enjoy bicycling, fishing, and Padres baseball.</p>
